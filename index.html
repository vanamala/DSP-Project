					This is the place where you have to write your abstract. Write a brief description about your work here. Mention the features that you have used in your work and their respective motivations. : Activity Recognition is an emerging field of research, born from the larger fields of ubiquitous computing, context-aware computing and multimedia. Recently, recognizing everyday life activities becomes
					one of the challenges for pervasive computing.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					 When we watch a person, it is easy for us to tell what activity they are performing even if we have never seen them in the past. This is because our brains are already trained to understand human activities. When viewing the activity, the brain compares it to thousands of activities it has memorized and pops out the one that matches. Similarly, a computer can identify the activity one is performing based on activities we have trained it to identify. <br>
					 On a computer, a machine learning algorithm can be used to “learn” human activities and detect the activity being performed for the new data that is collected. A detection task such as this, which involves categorizing data into separate “classes” is called classification. Applying a classification algorithm to this task involves two steps: training and detection. The training step builds a model which maps training data to certain categories. The detection step maps new data to a category. <br>

						We will be given accelerometer data from 3 activities namely: Standing, Running and Cycling and we need to classify/detect which activity is being performed, from those data entries.

						Each time series A<sub>i</sub>, with i = {x, y, z} has been filtered with a digital filter in order to separate low frequencies components and high frequencies component. The cut-off frequency has been set to 1Hz, arbitrarily. In this way, we obtain for each time series, three more time series A<sub>ij</sub> with j = {b, dc, ac}, where b, dc, ac represent respectively the time series without filtering, the time series resulting from a low pass filtering and the time series resulting from a high pass filtering. Finally, we extract features from each one of the time series. A successful technique for extracting features from sequential motion data has been demonstrated to be windowing with overlapping. From each window, we propose to extract the following features: root mean squared value of integration of acceleration in a window, mean value of Minmax sums, mean value, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and correlation between each pairwise of accelerometer axis. <br>
						##All this is tentative as of now and we will undertake only those features that has good classifying performance and have simplicity in their implementation.
