					This is the place where you have to write your abstract. Write a brief description about your work here. Mention the features that you have used in your work and their respective motivations. : Activity Recognition is an emerging field of research, born from the larger fields of ubiquitous computing, context-aware computing and multimedia. Recently, recognizing everyday life activities becomes
					one of the challenges for pervasive computing.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					 When we watch a person, it is easy for us to tell what activity they are performing even if we have never seen them in the past. This is because our brains are already trained to understand human activities. When viewing the activity, the brain compares it to thousands of activities it has memorized and pops out the one that matches. Similarly, a computer can identify the activity one is performing based on activities we have trained it to identify. <br>
					 On a computer, a machine learning algorithm can be used to “learn” human activities and detect the activity being performed for the new data that is collected. A detection task such as this, which involves categorizing data into separate “classes” is called classification. Applying a classification algorithm to this task involves two steps: training and detection. The training step builds a model which maps training data to certain categories. The detection step maps new data to a category. <br>

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						Each time series A<sub>i</sub>, with i = {x, y, z} has been filtered with a digital filter in order to separate low frequencies components and high frequencies component. The cut-off frequency has been set to 1Hz, arbitrarily. In this way, we obtain for each time series, three more time series A<sub>ij</sub> with j = {b, dc, ac}, where b, dc, ac represent respectively the time series without filtering, the time series resulting from a low pass filtering and the time series resulting from a high pass filtering. Finally, we extract features from each one of the time series. A successful technique for extracting features from sequential motion data has been demonstrated to be windowing with overlapping. From each window, we propose to extract the following features: root mean squared value of integration of acceleration in a window, mean value of Minmax sums, mean value, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, mean and variance of continuous wavelet transform and correlation between each pairwise of accelerometer axis. <br>

					<div class="text">

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						The proposed technique is described by three main steps. Firstly we get the raw data from accelerometer and then convert it into usable csv format, separating the coordinates by column. Second step is to extract the above mentioned features taking a window size of 10. Third step is to feed the data in classification algorithms to classify the given activities.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						Since, we couldn't get any datset from any source, we recorded it on our own. Initially, we recorded for a total of 2700 samples (1350 seconds, 2 samples per second) for each of our three activities, Running, Cycling and Standing. We extracted the features and found out that the accuracy was quite good. I verified the classification by again recording another set of samples, 600 samples for Running, 800 for Standing and 790 for Cycling. Yet again we got good accuracy on our new dataset.

						We did the initial training of the dataset with train ratio equal to 0.7. After testing the data on the 3/10 of the initial dataset, we tested the same classifier on our second dataset. After that, we merged both the datasets and then traoned another classifier to train with train ratio 0.7. The accuracy remained about same for all the three cases.
						The results for each of the classifier is given:

					<div class="text">

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						We classified the accelerometer data with quite a decent accuracy. The accuracy was cross checked with a new dataset and the accuracy remained approximately constant. This gave us the idea that the extracted features were able to be distinguished for the above activities, and thus gave high accuracy.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						The above work has been done only for running, standing and cycling. This project can be extended over classification of all normal day to day activities such as climbing, sleeping, walking, sitting etc. This would help us survey our daily routine and thus make proper improvements.
