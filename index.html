					<p> When we watch a person, it is easy for us to tell what activity they are performing even if we have never seen them in the past. This is because our brains are already trained to understand human activities. When viewing the activity, the brain compares it to thousands of activities it has memorized and pops out the one that matches. Similarly, a computer can identify the activity I am performing based on activities I have trained it to identify. </p>
					<p> On a computer, a machine learning algorithm can be used to “learn” human activities and detect the activity being performed for the new data that is collected. A detection task such as this, which involves categorizing data into separate “classes” is called classification. Another example of a classification task would be assigning a diagnosis to a patient as described by presence of certain symptoms. </p>
					<p> Applying a classification algorithm to this task involves two steps: training and detection. The training step builds a model which maps training data to certain categories. The detection step maps new data to a category. </p>
